# Fitbit-Web-API-Tutorial

This is a hands-on lab project on using public APIs for acquiring data from the web, storing them in NoSQL databases, and visualizing them on a web platform.
We experimented on a task that contains Fitbit data (acquired from the Fitbit Web API), Python, MongoDB and Streamlit. <br />

The tutorial includes the following sections:

A. Creating a Fitbit developer account and registering an application

B. API authorization in Python

C. API requests for data acquisition

D. Data storage in MongoDB

E. Setting up a Streamlit website with Python

F. Visualizations with Streamlit for understanding Fitbit data
