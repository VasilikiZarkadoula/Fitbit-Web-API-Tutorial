# Fitbit-Web-API-Tutorial

This is a hands-on lab project on using public APIs for acquiring data from the web, storing them in NoSQL databases, and visualizing them on a web platform.
We experimented on a task that contains Fitbit data (acquired from the Fitbit Web API), Python, MongoDB and Streamlit.
